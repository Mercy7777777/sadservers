# SadServers

## What

[SadServers](https://sadservers.com/) is a SaaS where users can test their Linux troubleshooting skills on real Linux servers.  

There's a collection of scenarios, a description of what's wrong and a test to check if the issue has been solved. The servers are spun up on the spot, users get an SSH shell via a browser window to an ephemeral server (destroyed after the alloted time for solving the challenge) and try and solve the problem.  

Problems include common software that run on Linux, like databases or web servers although knowledge of the details for the specific application is not necessarily required. It also includes scenarios where you do need to be familiar with the technology with the issue, for example, a Docker scenario. The scenarios are for the most part real-world ones, as in they are similar to issues that we have encountered.

SadServers is aimed primarily at users that are professional Software Developers (possibly), System Administrators, DevOps engineers, SREs, and related positions that require server debugging and troubleshooting skills.  

Particularly SadServers wants to test these professionals (or people aspiring to these jobs) in a way that would be useful for the purpose of a troubleshooting part of a job interview.

## Why

To scratch a personal itch and because there's nothing like this that I'm aware of. There are/were some sandbox solutions like Katacoda (shut down in May 2022) but nothing that gives you a specific problem with a condition of victory on a real server.  

It's also my not-so-secret hope that a sophisticated enough version of SadServers could be used by tech companies (or for companies that carry on job interviews on their behalf) to automate or facilitate the Linux troubleshooting interview section.  

An annoyance I found during my interviews is that sometimes instead of helping the interviewer unintentionally misleads you, or you feel like you are in a tv game where you have to maximize for some arbitrary points and come up with an game strategy that doesn't reflect real incident situations (do I try to keep solving this problem or do I move to the next one, which one is better?).
